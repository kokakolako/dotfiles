# My dotfile repository

Hey congratulation you found my dotfiles!
My current setup is an Arch Linux System with i3 as window manager

To be more exactly I'm using the following stuff:
* i3
* conky
* compton
* xfce4-terminal or urxvt
* ncmpcpp
* weechat
* zsh (with oh my zsh!)
* vim

If you need to you can grab easily my configurations 

*Cheers, Niklas KÃ¶hler*
