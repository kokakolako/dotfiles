My dotfile repository
=====================

Hey congratulation you have found my dotfiles!
My current setup is an arch battlestation with herbstluftwm as window manager

Im mostly proud of the following configurations:
------------------------------------------------

* vim
* herbstluftwm (+ dzen2 as panel)
* i3 (+ i3 bar / conky )
* zsh (+ oh my zsh!)
* dmenu2 (a very nice fork of the suckless.org dmenu)
* sxhkd
* dunst
* ncmpcpp (+ mpd)
* my custom prompt theme

When you are seeing some references to some scripts in $HOME/.bin, the
script is one of my [binfiles](https://github.com/kokakolako/binfiles).
To enjoy my configuration the most, you need to clone also this repo.
